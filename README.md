# **Libft** - Your First Own Library

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction

**Libft** is a project aimed at building a custom C library that reimplements standard libc functions and additional useful utilities. This library will be a fundamental tool for future projects at 42 School.

## ðŸ“œ Project Description

Libft consists of:

1. **Mandatory Part:** Reimplementing a set of standard libc functions with the prefix ft_.

2. **Additional Functions:** Implementing useful functions not found in libc.

3.**Bonus Part:** Implementing linked list manipulation functions.

## Note
-Most file and function names are prefixed with `ft`. This stands for "Forty Two," indicating their association with 42.
-The project instructions mandate that all source files be placed in the root directory. However, for the organization of this GitHub repository, the files are divided into subfolders.
